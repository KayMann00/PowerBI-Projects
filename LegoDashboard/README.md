# Lego Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard was developed as part of a guided analytics project through Maven Analytics. The goal was to explore the LEGO set universe across various themes, price tiers, and age ranges, using interactive visuals and decomposition trees to uncover insights about complexity, cost, and customer segmentation.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Analyze LEGO themes and categories by price, piece count, and age range
- Identify trends in pricing tiers and build complexity
- Enable interactive filtering by product type and customer target group
- Drill into category insights using decomposition trees

---

## ðŸ’¡ My Work

This project was completed independently using Power BI. Key steps included:

- Cleaning and loading the LEGO dataset
- Modeling relationships between product theme, type, and target age
- Building DAX measures to calculate averages and distributions
- Designing multiple report pages with interactive visuals and slicers
- Implementing decomposition tree visuals for deeper insights
