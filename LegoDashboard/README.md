# Lego In Progress Dashboard (Power BI)

This project was completed as part of a guided portfolio challenge from **Maven Analytics**. The goal was to analyze a dataset of LEGO sets and build a dashboard that explores the relationships between price, age range, themes, and build complexity.

I built this dashboard independently in Power BI, applying data modeling, DAX, and UX design principles to surface key insights for business stakeholders.

## 🎯 Objective

- Analyze LEGO set distribution across themes and categories
- Compare average price and pieces per set
- Understand pricing ranges by age group and theme
- Drill into detailed categories using decomposition trees

## 💼 My Role & Skills

Although the dataset and business challenge were provided by Maven Analytics, I handled:
- All **Power BI report development**
- **Data modeling** and relationships
- **DAX measures** for average price, piece count, and category-level insights
- **Slicer filters** and interactive layout
- A clean visual theme designed for executive readability
