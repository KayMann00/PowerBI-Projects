# Lego In Progress Dashboard (Power BI)

> A Power BI dashboard analyzing LEGO set development across price, age range, and theme.  
> Built as part of a Maven Analytics portfolio challenge.

---

## 📘 Project Summary

This dashboard was created as part of a guided project from **Maven Analytics**. The goal was to analyze a dataset of LEGO sets and deliver an executive-level report that offers insight into product complexity, pricing tiers, age targeting, and thematic trends.

Although the dataset and prompt were provided, all report building, data modeling, and DAX calculations were completed independently using Power BI.
